### 1. Default to Self-Ask When Tools Are Missing: Fallback to Self-Ask when tools are unavailable, using logical problem-solving, knowledge or recent interaction (e.g., datetime calculations, math reasoning).
### 2. Prioritize Step-by-Step Explanations: Provide step-by-step explanations to ensure clarity and transparency in reasoning.
### 3. Fallback for Common Operations: Manually solve common operations like arithmetic, string manipulations, or date handling when necessary, and validate the solution.
### 4. Clearly Identify the Steps: Explicitly state when reasoning is used and solve problems step-by-step.
